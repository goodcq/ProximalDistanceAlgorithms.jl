Without loss of generality, take \(\by = \boldsymbol{0}\) and
let \(B_{r} = \{\bx : \|\bx\| = r\}\).
Both \(B_{r}\) and its image under \(\bD\) are bounded so there exists \(\delta_{1}(r)\) such that \(\dist(\bD \bx, S) \le \delta_{1}(r)\) for every \(\bx \in B\), namely \(\delta_{1}(r) = \dist(\bD(B_{r}), S)\).
Note that \(\delta_{1}(r)\) is decreasing in \(r\).
Because \(y \notin B_{r}\) there must exist a value \(\delta_{2}(r) > 0\) such that \(f(x) \ge f(y) + \delta_{2}(r)\) for every \(\bx \in B_{r}\).
Naturally, one may choose \(\delta_{2}(r) = \min_{\bx \in B_{r}} f(\bx) - f(\by)\).
Thus, the choice \(\delta(r) = \max\{\delta_{1}(r), \delta_{2}(r)\}\) furnishes the required constant provided \(\delta_{2}(r) \ge \delta_{1}(r)\).
Otherwise, it is possible that \(f(\bx) < f(\by) + \delta(r)\) for some \(\bx \in B\).
In this case the compactness argument shows that uniqueness of \(\by\) is violated and so we must choose a different value for \(r\).
