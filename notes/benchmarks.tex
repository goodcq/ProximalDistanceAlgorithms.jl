\section*{\center Convex Regression}

Results based on data generated by sampling the function \(\varphi(\bx) = \|\bx\|^{2}\) uniformly over the cube \([-1,1]^{d}\), with \(d\) denoting the number of covariates.
Each of the \(n\) sample points where then perturbed by deviates \(\varepsilon_{i} \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, \sigma^{2})\) with \(\sigma = 0.1\).
Two proximal distance algorithms are used: an algorithm map relying on the closed-form solution to the stationary points of a surrogate function (denoted MM), and a second based on steepest descent (SD).
In each scenario, an algorithm is run for a total of 1000 iterations.

\section*{\center Metric Nearness}

Results based on randomly generated distance matrices.
Metric projection is based on the Frobenius norm imposed on the difference between the putative solution and the original data.
No acceleration is used here. (TODO)
